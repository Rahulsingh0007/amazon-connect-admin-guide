# Rules<a name="concepts-rules"></a>

A rule is an action that Amazon Connect automatically performs, based on conditions you specify\.

For example, after you set up an external application to generate tasks automatically, you add rules that tell Amazon Connect when to create tasks, and how to route them\.

For Contact Lens, you can create rules to automatically categorize contacts based on uttered keywords and phrases\. Or, if you enable real\-time analytics, you can add rules that automatically alert supervisors when a customer experience issue occurs\. 

Amazon Connect includes a graphical user interface that makes it easy to create rules\. To learn more, see the following topics:
