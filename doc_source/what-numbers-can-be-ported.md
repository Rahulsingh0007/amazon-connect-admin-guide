# Can my number be ported to Amazon Connect?<a name="what-numbers-can-be-ported"></a>

Not all phone numbers can be ported\. The ability to port a specific phone number depends on several factors\. For example:
+ The regulations in the country or region of the phone number\. 
+ Agreements between the losing and winning carriers\.
+ The type of phone number being ported\.
+ Your service contract with your current service provider\.

To find out if a phone number that you currently own—whether local, mobile, or toll\-free—can be ported to Amazon Connect: 

1. See if your country or region supports number porting: [Region requirements for ordering and porting phone numbers](phone-number-requirements.md)\.

1. Then get started by [submitting an Amazon Connect support ticket for number verification](about-porting.md#step1-porting)\. 

## Porting numbers purchased from other contact center providers<a name="numbers-from-other-providers"></a>

In most cases, you can port numbers that were purchased from other contact center providers\. Confirm with your current contact center provider who holds the assignment to the number, and work with them to ensure the correct information is provided in the Letter of Authorization \(LOA\)\. 

## Port short phone numbers<a name="port-short-numbers"></a>

Because of Telecom regulations in various countries or regions, the short phone number will need to be evaluated on a case\-by\-case basis\. To verify if your phone number can be ported to Amazon Connect, [submit an Amazon Connect support ticket](about-porting.md#step1-porting)\. 

## Port a number to one EU Region only<a name="port-across-eu-regions"></a>

The Amazon Connect Regions of EU\-CENTRAL\-1 and EU\-WEST\-2 are symmetrical European Regions that offer the same carrier coverage for telephony\. If a phone number cannot be ported to an instance in one of these Regions, then it cannot be ported to an instance in the other\. 

If you had a phone number ported into the EU\-CENTRAL\-1 or EU\-WEST\-2 Regions, and want to move it to the other Region, [submit an Amazon Connect support ticket](about-porting.md#step1-porting) for assistance\. 

The same is true for the North America Regions of US\-EAST\-1 and US\-WEST\-2\. 

## Port a subset of numbers from a block<a name="port-subset-of-numbers"></a>

If you have a block of numbers, in some instances Amazon Connect can port a subset or portion of your phone numbers\. In other cases, it is required by the carrier to port full block of phone numbers\. 

If you want to port only a subset of the phone numbers you currently own to Amazon Connect, [submit an Amazon Connect support ticket](about-porting.md#step1-porting) to verify whether the phone numbers can be ported\. We will verify the actions that can be completed and assist you with next steps\.

**Note**  
If you port only a subset of the phone numbers, you will still be liable for the remaining phone numbers with the original carrier and any associated fees\.   
If your intent to is release the remaining phone numbers not being ported to Amazon Connect, we recommend waiting until the requested porting has been completed to avoid any disruptions to service\. 

## Letter of compromise<a name="letter-of-compromise"></a>

Before porting phone numbers, some customers ask for a letter of compromise stating that they will be allowed to move their phone numbers from Amazon Connect to another service, if their contact center moves\. Because of Telecom regulations in various countries, the phone number will need to be evaluated on a case\-by\-case basis\. To verify that your phone number can be ported to Amazon Connect, [submit a ticket to Amazon Connect support](about-porting.md#step1-porting) \.
