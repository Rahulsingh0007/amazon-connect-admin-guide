# Search for content using Amazon Connect Wisdom<a name="search-for-answers"></a>

You can search and find content across multiple repositories, such as frequently asked questions \(FAQs\), wikis, articles, and step\-by\-step instructions for handling different customer issues\. 

For example, you can type questions or phrases in the search box \(such as, "how long after purchase can handbags be exchanged?"\) without having to guess which keywords will work\. Wisdom searches the connected sources, and returns relevant information adjacent to your Contact Control Panel \(CCP\)\. 

You can search for content at any time: while on a contact, on After Contact Work, or between contacts\.
