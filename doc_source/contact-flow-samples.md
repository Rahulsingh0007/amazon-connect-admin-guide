# Sample flows<a name="contact-flow-samples"></a>

Amazon Connect includes a set of sample flows that show you how to perform common functions\. They are designed to help you learn how to create your own flows that work in a similar way\. For example, if you want to add a queued callback flow to your call center, take a look at the [Sample queued callback](sample-queued-callback.md) flow\.

**To explore how the sample flows work**

1. Claim a number if you haven't already: go to **Channels**, **Phone numbers**, **Claim a number**\.

1. Choose the **DID** tab, then choose a number\.

1. In **Flow / IVR** use the drop down to choose the sample flow you want to try\. Click **Save**\.

1. Call the number\. The sample flow that you selected starts\. 

   We recommend opening the sample flow in the flow designer and following along to see how it works while you're experiencing it\.

**To open a sample flow in the flow designer**
