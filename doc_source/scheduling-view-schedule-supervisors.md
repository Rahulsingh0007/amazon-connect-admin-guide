# How supervisors view published schedules \(Preview\)<a name="scheduling-view-schedule-supervisors"></a>

After a scheduler publishes a schedule, it's official\. Agents can now view their individual scheduling using their agent application\. Supervisors can also view their agents schedules using the Amazon Connect console\.

Supervisors with **Scheduling**, **Schedule manager \- Edit** permissions in their security profile can edit agent schedules\.

**Important**  
When a supervisor edits an agent schedule and publishes it, the change appears immediately to the agent\. The agent receives an email notification that their schedule has been changed\. They do not need to refresh their browser for the agent application to reflect the change\.

The following image shows a sample schedule for a supervisor's team:
