+ Your agent ID\.
+ Your agent password\.

After you have that information, here's how to log in and get started\.

1. Using Chrome or Firefox, open the CCP by using the URL that you received from your administrator\.

**Important**  
Closing the CCP window doesn't automatically sign out an agent\. Amazon Connect still tries to route contacts to them\. To change this behavior, a developer can customize CCP for your contact center\. For instructions, see [Log out agents automatically when they close their CCP](automatic-logout.md)\. 

1. At the top of the CCP, select the **Change Status** dropdown menu\. 

1. Choose **Log out**\.
