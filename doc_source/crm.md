# Set up pre\-built integrations<a name="crm"></a>

Use pre\-built integrations to generate tasks based on events in external applications, or create customer profiles based on data in external applications\. These integrations are built on top of Amazon AppFlow and Amazon EventBridge to enable easy access to your data that's stored outside of Amazon Connect\.

For more information about Amazon AppFlow and Amazon EventBridge, see the documentation: [Amazon AppFlow User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appflow/latest/userguide/what-is-appflow.html) and [Amazon EventBridge User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/)\.

In addition, check out the [Amazon AppIntegrations Service API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appintegrations/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html), which enables you to access and configure AppIntegrations associations programmatically with Amazon Connect instances\.
