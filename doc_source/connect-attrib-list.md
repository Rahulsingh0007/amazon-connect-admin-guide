# List of available contact attributes and their JSONPath reference<a name="connect-attrib-list"></a>

The following tables describe the contact attributes available in Amazon Connect\.

The JSONPath reference for each attribute is provided so you can [create dynamic text strings](create-dynamic-text-strings.md)\. 

## System attributes<a name="attribs-system-table"></a>

These are predefined attributes in Amazon Connect\. You can reference system attributes, but you cannot create them\. 

Not all blocks in a contact flow support using System attributes\. For example, you cannot use a System attribute to store customer input\. Instead, use a user\-defined attribute to store the data input by a customer\.


| Attribute | Description | Type | JSONPath Reference | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| Customer number | The customer’s phone number\. When used in an outbound whisper flow, this is the number that the agents dialed to reach the customer\. When used in inbound flows, this is the number from which the customer placed the call\. This attribute is included in Contact Trace Records \(CTRs\)\. When used in a Lambda function, it's included in the input object under CustomerEndpoint\.  | System | $\.CustomerEndpoint\.Address | 
| Dialed number | The number the customer dialed to call your contact center\. This attribute is included in CTRs\. When used in a Lambda function, it's included in the input object under SystemEndpoint\. | System | $\.SystemEndpoint\.Address | 
| Customer callback number | The number that Amazon Connect uses to call back the customer\. This number can be the one used for a queued callback, or when an agent is dialing from the CCP\. Transfer to callback queue functionality, or for an agent dialing from the CCP\. The default value is the number that the customer used to call your contact center\. However, it can be overwritten with the **Set callback number** block\.  This attribute is not included in CTRs, and it's not accessible in Lambda input\. However, you can copy the attribute to a user\-defined attribute with the Set contact attribute block, which is included in CTRs\. You can also pass this attribute as a Lambda input parameter in an Invoke AWS Lambda function block, which is not included in CTRs\.  | System | not applicable | 
| Stored customer input | An attribute created from the most recent invocation of a **Store customer input** block\. The attribute values created from the most recent Store customer input block invocation\. This attribute is not included in CTRs, and is not accessible in Lambda input\. You can copy the attribute to a user\-defined attribute with the Set contact attribute block, which is included in CTRs\. You can also pass this attribute as a Lambda input parameter in an Invoke AWS Lambda function block,  | System | not applicable | 
| Queue name | The name of the queue\. | System | $\.Queue\.Name |

## Agent attributes<a name="attribs-agent"></a>

The following table lists the agent attributes available in Amazon Connect\.


| Attribute | Description | Type | JSONPath Reference | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| Agent User name | The user name an agent uses to log in to Amazon Connect\. | System | $\.Agent\.UserName | 
| Agent First name | The agent’s first name as entered in their Amazon Connect user account\.  | System | $\.Agent\.FirstName | 
| Agent Last name | The agent’s last name as entered in their Amazon Connect user account\. | System | $\.Agent\.LastName | 
| Agent ARN | The ARN of the agent\. | System | $\.Agent\.ARN | 

**Note**  
When you use an agent contact attribute in a **Transfer to agent** flow, the agent attributes reflect the target agent, not the one who initiated the transfer\.

Agent attributes are available only in the following types of contact flows:
+ Agent whisper
+ Customer whisper
+ Agent hold
+ Customer whisper
+ Outbound whisper
+ Transfer to agent\. In this case, the agent attributes reflect the target agent, not the one who initiated the transfer\.

Agent attributes are not available in the following contact flow types:
+ Customer queue
+ Transfer to queue
+ Inbound contact flow

## Queue attributes<a name="attribs-system-metrics-table"></a>

These system attributes are returned when you use a **Get queue metrics** block in your contact flow\.

## Media streams attributes<a name="media-stream-attribs"></a>

The following table lists the attributes that you can use to identify the location in the live media stream where the customer audio starts and stops\.


| Attribute | Description | Type | JSONPath Reference |

## Amazon Lex contact attributes<a name="attribs-lex-table"></a>

The following table lists the attributes that are returned from Amazon Lex bots\.


| Attribute | Description | Type | JSONPath Reference | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| Dialog state | The last dialog state returned from an Amazon Lex bot\. The value is 'Fulfilled' if an intent was returned to the contact flow\. | External | $\.Lex\.DialogState |

| Slots | Map of intent slots \(key/value pairs\) Amazon Lex detected from the user input during the interaction\.   | External | $\.Lex\.Slots\.slotName | 
| Session attributes |   Map of key\-value pairs representing the session\-specific context information\.   | External | $\.Lex\.SessionAttributes\.attributeKey | 

## Lambda contact attributes<a name="attribs-lambda-table"></a>

Lambda attributes are returned as key\-value pairs from the most recent invocation of an **Invoke AWS Lambda function** block\. External attributes are overwritten with each invocation of the Lambda function\.

To reference external attributes in JSONPath, use:
+ `$.External.attributeName`

where `AttributeName` is the attribute name, or the key of the key\-value pair returned from the function\. 

For example, if the function returns a contact ID, reference the attribute with ` $.External.ContactId`\. When referencing a contact ID returned from Amazon Connect, the JSONPath is `$.ContactId`\. 

**Note**  
Note the inclusion of `.External` in the JSONPath reference when the attribute is external to Amazon Connect\. Make sure to match the case for attribute names returned from external sources\.

For more information about using attributes in Lambda functions, see [Invoke AWS Lambda functions](connect-lambda-functions.md)\.

These attributes are not included in CTRs, not passed to the next Lambda invocation, and not passed to the CCP for screenpop information\. However, they can be passed as Lambda function inputs on an **Invoke AWS Lambda function** block, or copied to user\-defined attributes via the **Set contact attributes** block\. When used in **Set contact attributes** blocks, the attributes that are copied are included in CTRs, and can be used in the CCP\.

## User\-defined attributes<a name="user-defined-attributes"></a>

For all other attributes we've defined the key and Amazon Connect provides the value\. For user\-defined attributes, however, you provide a name for the key and the value\.

Use user\-defined attributes in situations where you want to store values in a contact flow, and then refer to those values later\. For example, if you integrate Amazon Connect and a CRM or other system, you might want to get input from the customer such as their member number\. Then you can use that member number retrieve information about the member from the CRM, and/or use the member number throughout the contact flow, etc\.


| Attribute | Description | Type | JSONPath Reference | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| Any name you choose | A user\-defined attribute has two parts: [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/connect-attrib-list.html)  | User\-defined | $\.Attributes\.*name\_of\_your\_destination\_key* | 

To create user\-defined attributes, use the **Set contact attributes** block\.
