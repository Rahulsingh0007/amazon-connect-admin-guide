# Send a test message for Apple Business Chat<a name="send-test-message"></a>

After onboarding to the Apple Business Chat account, use the following steps to send a test message to make sure the integration is set up properly\.

## Step 1: Add internal testers to your Business Chat account<a name="add-internal-tester"></a>

1. Sign in to [Apple Business Register](https://register.apple.com/)\. 

1. Choose **Business Chat Accounts** and select the account to add testers\. 

1. Scroll down the page to **Account Testing**\.

1. Add the Apple IDs of your internal testers\. 

1. When your list is complete and you are ready to begin testing, choose **Send to new testers** to send an instructional email to your testers\. 

An instructional email containing a link to your Business Chat conversation is sent to the Apple ID email address of each tester\. If a tester does not receive the email, then recheck that their email address is provided in the Account Testing section\. It's most likely that the email address is incorrect or it's not an Apple ID\. For security reasons, Apple cannot verify Apple ID email addresses\. 

## Step 2: Test sending and receiving messages<a name="test-send-receive-messages"></a>

When your testers get the instructional email, they will need to activate the link in it\. After doing this, they can send messages to your agents, who can then reply from the Contact Control Panel \(CCP\)\. 

Note the following:

1. Design a test to trigger all of your Apple Business Chat features\.

1. You should observe that messages sent from an iOS device arrive to your test business\. Employees testing from your support agent desktop should be able to respond to these test messages\.

1. Your testers may notice your brand colors are not visible in the Messages header\. Brand color is not available while your account is in test mode\. The colors for your brand will display correctly after your account goes online\. 

1. If you send the testing link to someone whose email is not listed in the Account Testing section, they will not be able to send messages\.

1. If you provide a Redirect Page URL and your testers try to enter Business Chat from an unsupported device, they will land either on a default or redirected page\. You can set your Redirect Page URL in the **Unsupported Devices** section at the bottom of your Business Chat account page\.

**To begin testing**

1. Check that your testers are using a device with a supported iOS: iOS 11\.3 and later, or macOS 10\.13\.4\.

1. Ask your testers to doing the following: 

   1. Use their supported devices to find the email sent to them\.

   1. Open the email from the supported device, and then choose the link\. It takes them to a Business Chat conversation in the Messages app\.

## Troubleshoot<a name="troubleshoot-test-messages"></a>

If you encounter any issues when sending a test message, follow these steps: 

1. Confirm that youâ€™ve allowlisted your email address/Apple ID as a tester in your Business Chat account\.

1. Confirm the following settings on your Apple device:
   + Go to **Settings** > **Messages** and check that **iMessage** is enabled\.
   + Go to **Settings** > **Messages** > **Send & Receive** and check that the AppleID is correct and messages are allowed to receive\.

1. Check that you're using a supported iOS\. Apple devices running iOS 11\.3 and later or macOS 10\.13\.4 and later support Business Chat\.

1. When you selected Amazon Connect as your MSP in your Apple Account, did you select ** Amazon Connect** from the dropdown? Or did you enter the following URL:
