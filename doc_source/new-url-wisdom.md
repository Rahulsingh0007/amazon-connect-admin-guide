# Access Wisdom in the agent application<a name="new-url-wisdom"></a>

If you're using the CCP that is provided with Amazon Connect, after you enable Wisdom, share the following URL with your agents so they can access it:
+ **https://*instance name*\.my\.connect\.aws/agent\-app\-v2/**

If you access your instance using the **awsapps\.com** domain, use the following URL: 
+ **https://*instance name*\.awsapps\.com/connect/agent\-app\-v2/**

For help finding your instance name, see [Find your Amazon Connect instance name](find-instance-name.md)\.

By using the new URL, your agents can view the CCP and Wisdom in the same browser window\.

If CCP is embedded in your agent's application, see [Initialization for CCP, Customer Profiles, and Wisdom]( https://github.com/amazon-connect/amazon-connect-streams/blob/master/Documentation.md#initialization-for-ccp-customer-profiles-and-wisdom ) in the *Amazon Connect Streams Documentation* for information about how to include Wisdom\. 

For more information about the agent's experience using Wisdom, see [Search for content using Amazon Connect Wisdom](search-for-answers.md)\.
