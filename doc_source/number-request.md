# Request numbers, international numbers, or termination points<a name="number-request"></a>

**Important**  
To purchase and own a phone number, country or region regulations often require:   
A local office address\.
Specific identification documents\.
For identification requirements by country, see [Region requirements for ordering and porting phone numbers](phone-number-requirements.md)\.   
In most countries it takes 2\-6 weeks for us to fulfill your request\. In some cases it can take up to 60 days\. If you need a number by a certain date, let us know in your AWS Support case\.

**Note**  
Amazon does not provide premium rate or higher cost services\. If you want these services we recommend you contract with specialist providers to route calls into Amazon Connect DID's following local country regulations\.

To request international phone numbers that require documentation, or numbers not available within a specific region, create an AWS Support case\. In the support case, you must specify exactly how many numbers you want for each country\. 

1. Go to [Create case](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/cases#/create)\.

1. Choose **Service limit increase**\.

1. In **Limit type** select **Amazon Connect**\.

1. In **Use case description**, enter the number that you want to request or exactly how many numbers you want for each country\. If you need the number by a certain date, include that, too\.

1. In **Contact options**, choose whether we should contact you by email or phone\. 

1. Choose **Submit**\. 

We'll contact you to help with your request\. 

After your request is approved, the exact number of requested phone numbers appear in your Amazon Connect console for you to claim\. You won't have access to all available numbers in that country\.

## Requirements for Custom Termination Points<a name="custom-termination-points"></a>

In the Asia Pacific \(Sydney\) Region, you can request Custom Termination Points\.

1. Have a current toll\-free national service that allows you to set Custom Termination Points as a destination for customer phone calls\.

1. Cannot port or move Custom Termination Points to a different telephony provider once assigned by Amazon Connect\.

1. Will be billed at the standard daily rate for claimed Australian phone numbers and DID inbound usage fees\.

1. You are responsible for adding the Custom Termination Points in your existing toll\-free national service\.
