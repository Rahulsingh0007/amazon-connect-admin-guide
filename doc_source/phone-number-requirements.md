# Region requirements for ordering and porting phone numbers<a name="phone-number-requirements"></a>

Country or region regulations often require a local office address and specific identification documents to purchase and own a phone number\. The address that you provide can be the business or personal address where the phone numbers are used\. 

For a list of the telephony capabilities that Amazon Connect provides, see the [Amazon Connect Telecoms Country Coverage Guide](https://d1v2gagwb6hfe1.cloudfront.net/Amazon_Connect_Telecoms_Coverage.pdf)\. 

Following is a list of ID Requirements by country or region\. When you [ request an international number](number-request.md), we'll work with you to submit your documents\. 

**Note**  
After your numbers are ordered or ported, the exact number of requested phone numbers appear in your Amazon Connect console for you to claim\. You won't have access to all available numbers in that country\.
