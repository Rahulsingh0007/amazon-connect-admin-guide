# Case event streams<a name="case-event-streams"></a>

Amazon Connect Cases event streams provide you with near real\-time updates when cases are created or modified within your Amazon Connect Cases domain\. The events published to the stream include these resource events:
+ Case created
+ Cases modified
+ Related items \(Comments, Calls, Chats, Tasks\) are added to a case

You can use the case event streams to integrate streams into your data lake solutions, create dashboards that display case performance metrics, implement business rules or automated actions based on case events, and configure alerting tools to trigger custom notifications of specific case activity\.
