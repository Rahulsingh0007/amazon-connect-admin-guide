# Delete your instance<a name="delete-connect-instance"></a>

If you no longer want to use an instance, you can delete it\. When you delete an instance, the phone number claimed for the instance is released back to inventory\. You lose all settings, data, metrics, and reports associated with the instance\. When customers call the phone number you've released, they'll get a message that it's not a working phone number\.

**Important**  
You cannot undo the deletion of an instance or restore settings or data from the instance after it is deleted\.
