# Enable Customer Profiles<a name="customer-profiles"></a>

To help agents deliver more efficient and personalized customer service, Amazon Connect enables you to combine information from external applications, such as Salesforce, with contact history from Amazon Connect\. This creates a customer profile that has all the information agents need during customer interactions in a single place\.

With a single view of customer information and contact history, agents can quickly confirm the customer's identity and determine the reason for the call or chat\. 

Currently, Amazon Connect Customer Profiles can be used in compliance with [GDPR](http://aws.amazon.com/compliance/gdpr-center) and is pending additional certifications held by Amazon Connect\.

The following image shows an agent's Contact Control Panel \(CCP\), and an example of how customer profile information may appear adjacent to it for the current interaction\.
