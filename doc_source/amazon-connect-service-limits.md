# Amazon Connect service quotas<a name="amazon-connect-service-limits"></a>

**All service quotas can be adjusted/increased unless otherwise noted\.**
+ To submit a service quota increase, use the [Amazon Connect service quotas increase form](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create?issueType=service-limit-increase&limitType=service-code-connect)\. You must be signed in to your AWS account to access the form\.
+ It can take up to a few days to increase your service quota\. If you're increasing your quotas as part of a larger project, be sure to add this time to your plan\.
+ Use the same form to submit a request to port your US phone number from your current carrier to Amazon Connect\. For more information about porting phone numbers, see [Port your current phone number](port-phone-number.md)\.


| Item | Default quotas for new accounts created February, 2020 or later\. [Learn more](#default-quotas) | 
| --- | --- | 
|  Active tasks per instance  |  2500  | 
|  AWS Lambda functions per instance  |  35  | 
|  Agent status per instance  |  50 This quota cannot be increased\.  | 
|  Amazon Connect instances per account  |  2  | 
|  Amazon Lex bots per instance  |  50  | 
|  Concurrent calls per instance  |  10  **What is counted?** All calls currently being handled by agents or waiting in a queue for an agent\. Callbacks waiting in a callback queue are not counted until the callback is offered to an available agent\. If this quota is exceeded, contacts will get a reorder tone \(also known as a fast busy tone\), which indicates no transmission path to the called number is available\.   You can calculate your configured quota using CloudWatch metrics\. For instructions, see [Use CloudWatch metrics to calculate concurrent call quota](monitoring-cloudwatch.md#connect-cloudwatch-concurrent-call-quota)\.  Or, edit a queue and enter an exceptionally large number for the contact limit\. The resulting error message will display your quota\. For example, in the following image, it shows the quota for that instance is 99\. ![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/images/concurrent-call-quota.png)   | 
|  Concurrent chats per instance  |  100 This includes chats that are waiting\. If this quota is exceeded, the API call fails with a quota exceeded error\.  | 
|  Contact flows per instance  |  100  | 
|  Hours of operation per instance  |  100  | 
|  Phone numbers per instance  |  5  | 
|  Prompts per instance  |  500  | 
|  Queues per instance  |  50  | 
|  Queues per routing profile per instance  |  50 This quota refers to number of queue/channel combinations per routing profile\. For example, in the following image there are two queues, but there are three queue\-channel combinations: BasicQueue\-Voice, BasicQueue\-Chat, and Queue10\-Voice\. This counts three towards the service limit of 50\. ![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/images/routing-profile-queue-channel-combinations.png)  | 
|  Quick connects per instance  |  100  | 
|  Rate of API requests  |  See [Amazon Connect API throttling quotas](#connect-api-quotas)\.  | 
|  Reports per instance  |  500 Personal saved reports count towards the reports per instance\. For example, if one of your supervisors saves a report every day, it will count towards your overall number of saved reports per instance\. As a best practice, we recommend you implement policies so reports don't pile up\.   | 
|  Routing profiles per instance  |  100  | 
|  Scheduled reports per instance  |  50  | 
|  Security profiles per instance  |  100  | 
|  User hierarchy groups per instance  |  500 This quota applies to the total number of hierarchy groups you have, across all levels\. There is no feature limit for how many hierarchy groups you can have for each level\. For example, one level could have 500 hierarchy groups, which would reach the quota for your instance\.  | 
|  Users per instance  |  500  | 

**Note**  
Amazon Connect is not available to customers in India using Amazon Web Services through Amazon Internet Services Pvt\. Ltd \(AISPL\)\. You will receive an error message if you try to create an instance in Amazon Connect\.
