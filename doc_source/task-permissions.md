# Block agents from creating tasks<a name="task-permissions"></a>

To block agents from being able to create tasks, assign the **Contact Control Panel \(CCP\)**, **Restrict task creation** permission\. By default this permissions is unchecked, which means all agents can create tasks\.

For information about how add more permissions to an existing security profile, see [Update security profiles](update-security-profiles.md)\.

By default, the **Admin** security profile already has permissions to perform all tasks activities\.
