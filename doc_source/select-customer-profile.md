# Accept incoming contacts with Customer Profiles<a name="select-customer-profile"></a>

When a call or chat is connected to your Contact Control Panel \(CCP\), Amazon Connect, in the same browser window, automatically displays customer profiles that may match the incoming phone number\. 

Before agents can access customer profiles, the Amazon Connect administrator must enable the Customer Profiles feature, grant agents the appropriate permissions, and integrate Customer Profiles into your agent application\. For more information, see [Enable Customer Profiles for your instance](enable-customer-profiles.md)\.

## Example 1: Auto\-populate the customer profile<a name="example1-select-customer-profile"></a>

As soon as Amazon Connect matches the phone number \(voice\) or email address \(chat\) with an existing customer profile, it automatically displays the profile even though you may not have accepted the contact yet\.

The following image shows what your Contact Control Panel \(CCP\) may look like when there's an incoming call\. A customer profile has been found that matches the caller, and Amazon Connect is loading the data\.

This next example shows what it might look like after you've accepted and joined the call, and Amazon Connect displays the customer's profile\. In this case, Amazon Connect found the customer's profile based on their phone number\. If this were a chat conversation, Amazon Connect might match the customer's profile based on their email address or name\.

+ Choose **Associate** to associate the contact record of the current contact with the customer profile\. 
+ If you choose **Associate** by mistake, you can continue to browse other customer profiles, and associate the contact with a different customer profile, or create a new profile\. You can associate a contact with customer profile multiple times during an interaction, including during After Contact Work \(ACW\) time\. Only the last association remains, before you clear the contact\.

## Example 2: Accept incoming contact, no customer profile found<a name="example2-select-customer-profile"></a>

If no results are returned when a call or chat comes in, do the following: 

1. Search for the customer's profile using their email address, name, or account number\. An *account number* is a unique identifier for the customer in your business, such as a member number or a customer relationship number\. 

1. If no customer profile is found, [create a new profile](create-new-customer-profile.md) for the contact\. The only required information is first name\.

In the following image, the agent searched for **John Doe**\. No matches were found so they chose **Create profile**\.

## Example 3: Accept incoming contact, multiple customer profiles found<a name="example3-select-customer-profile"></a>

In some cases, multiple profiles may be returned for the same call or chat\. Use the summary information to verify the customer's identity\. For example, ask the customer to verify their date of birth or their email address, and then associate the contact with the right customer profile\.

## Example 4: Search when not on contact<a name="example4-select-customer-profile"></a>

When there are no incoming contacts, you can search for customer profiles using phone number, name, email address, or account number\. For example, you might want to use this time to search for previous contacts, or completing a profile\.
