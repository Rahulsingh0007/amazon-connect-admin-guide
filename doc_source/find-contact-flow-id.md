# Find the contact flow ID<a name="find-contact-flow-id"></a>

The contact flow ID is the contact flow you want to use for inbound Apple Business Chat messages\. Contact flows define the experiences for your customer when they begin a new chat\.

You can either reuse an existing contact flow that youâ€™re already using for voice or chat contacts, or create a new one specifically for Apple Business Chat contacts\. For instructions about creating a new inbound contact flow, see [Create an inbound contact flow](create-contact-flow.md#create-inbound-contact-flow)\. 

For more information about contact flows, see [Create Amazon Connect contact flowsCreate contact flows](connect-contact-flows.md)\.

1. Log in to the Amazon Connect console with an **Admin** account, or an account assigned to a security profile that has permissions to view contact flows\.

1. On the navigation menu, choose **Routing**, **Contact flows**\.

1. Select the contact flow you want to use\.
