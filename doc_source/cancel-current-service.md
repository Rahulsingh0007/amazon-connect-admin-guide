# When do I cancel my current telecom service?<a name="cancel-current-service"></a>

Do not cancel your existing telecom service until your phone numbers have been ported and confirmed working in Amazon Connect\. 

Canceling your existing telecom service before your number is ported releases your phone number assignment, and may result in you losing the number\.
