# Not receiving calls on the ported number<a name="not-receiving-calls-after-porting"></a>

After the scheduled porting window has completed, if you are not receiving phone calls on the ported phone number, update your support ticket\. We will troubleshoot with our carrier to verify the porting status and identify the next steps to resolve issue\. 

Amazon Connect and our carriers make every effort to ensure number porting occurs with minimal downtime and without issues\. In all cases, the losing carrier is responsible for initiating the number porting and releasing your number to the winning carrier\. 

In rare situations, a number routing issue can occur, resulting in calls not arriving to Amazon Connect from the carrier\.
