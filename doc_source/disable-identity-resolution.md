# Disable Identity Resolution<a name="disable-identity-resolution"></a>

You can disable Identity Resolution when you no longer want it to automatically find similar profiles\. If you have consolidation criteria, all your criteria will be deleted and your profiles will no longer be automatically consolidated\. Profiles that have already been consolidated will remain consolidated\.
