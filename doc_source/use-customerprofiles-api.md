# Use the Customer Profiles API<a name="use-customerprofiles-api"></a>

For information about how to programmatically manage domains and profiles, see the [Amazon Connect Customer Profiles API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/customerprofiles/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html)\.

We recommend using the CustomerProfileJS open source library when integrating Customer Profiles into your own agent application\. For more information, see the CustomerProfilesJS repo on [Github](https://github.com/amazon-connect/amazon-connect-customer-profiles)\.

For more information about how to integrate your existing apps with Amazon Connect use [Amazon Connect Streams](https://github.com/aws/amazon-connect-streams)\. You can embed the Contact Control Panel \(CCP\) components into your app\.
