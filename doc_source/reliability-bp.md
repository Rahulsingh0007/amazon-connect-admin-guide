# Reliability<a name="reliability-bp"></a>

Reliability includes the ability of a system to recover from infrastructure or service disruptions, dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand, and mitigate disruptions such as misconfigurations or transient network issues\. As resiliency is handled as part of the service, there are no reliability practices unique to Amazon Connect beyond of what is covered in [Operational Excellence](operational-excellence.md)\. You can Ô¨Ånd prescriptive guidance on implementation in the [Reliability Pillar](https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/architecture/AWS-Reliability-Pillar.pdf) whitepaper\.
