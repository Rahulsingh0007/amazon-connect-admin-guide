# Troubleshoot issues in Contact Lens<a name="contact-lens-troubleshoot"></a>

## Why don't I see color\-coded bars on my Amazon Connect console?<a name="where-are-color-coded-bars"></a>

If your Amazon Connect console doesn't include color\-coded bars similar to those shown in the preceding image, check whether the conversation that you're trying to analyzed occurred before June 30, 2020\. 

This view of conversations works only if the Contact Lens is enabled, and then the conversation occurred after June 30, 2020\. This is because the feature that displays analyzed conversations in this format was released on June 30, 2020, and it can only be applied to conversations that happen after that time\. 

## Why don't I see or hear unredacted content?<a name="where-is-unredacted-content"></a>

If your organization is using the Contact Lens redaction feature, by default only redacted content appears in the Amazon Connect console\. 

You must have permissions to view unredacted content\. For more information, see [Security profile permissions for Contact Lens](permissions-for-contact-lens.md)\.
