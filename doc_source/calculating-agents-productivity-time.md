# Calculating Agent Adherent and Non\-Adherent Time<a name="calculating-agents-productivity-time"></a>

## Example<a name="example-calculating-prod-time"></a>

**Example 1:**

Agent A is scheduled to work from 8:00 to 11:00\.

They begin working at 7:30 and then take a break from 10:30 to 11:00\. From 7:30 to 8:00 the agent is neither adherent or non\-adherent since there is no schedule\.

From 8:00 to 10:30 the agent is adherent and from 10:30 to 11:00 the agent is non\-adherent because they were in Non\-Productive Time when they should have been productive\.

This means that Agent A’s Adherence was 83%\. \(Total Adherent Time was 150 minutes/Total Scheduled Time 180 minutes\) 

**Example 2:**

Agent B is scheduled to work from 9:00 to 10:30\.

They go on Break from 10:30 to 11:00, and then a team meeting from 11:00 to 12:00\. They begin working at 9:00 and end up working until 10:45\. Then picking the *Break* custom Non\-Productive Time status from 10:45\. They forget to switch their status to *Team Meeting* and leave it as *Break* until 12:00\. 

From 9:00 to 10:30 the agent was adherent but from 10:30 to 10:45 the agent was non\-adherent because they were in a productive state when they should have been in a non\-productive state\. From 10:45 to 12:00 they were adherent because they were in a non\-productive state the entire time\.

This means that Agent B’s adherence was 92% \(Total Adherent Time: 165 Minutes / Total Scheduled Time: 180 Minutes\)
