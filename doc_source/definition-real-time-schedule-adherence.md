# Real\-Time Schedule Adherence<a name="definition-real-time-schedule-adherence"></a>

Real\-Time agent adherence is available in a new table called **Agent Schedule Adherence**\. You can select this table from both the Real\-Time metrics landing page or within an existing report\. This table has the same functionality as an existing Agents table with the following additions

**Real\-Time Agent Adherence Status**
+ This will indicate whether an agent is adherent or non\-adherent in near real\-time\. For a definition of schedule adherence, see [Schedule Adherence](schedule-adherence.md)\.

**Scheduled Status**
+ This will indicate whether an agent is scheduled to be in productive time or non\-productive time\. If an agent is not scheduled, it will show as blank\. 

**Agent Adherence Duration**
+ The amount of time an agent has currently been adherent or non\-adherent\. When an agent changes between non\-adherent or adherent, this value will reset, as it represents the current amount of time\.

**Agent Adherence Percentage**
+ The percentage of time an agent has been adherent to their schedule\. For a definition of agent adherence percentage, see [Historical Schedule Adherence](definition-schedule-adherence.md)\.
