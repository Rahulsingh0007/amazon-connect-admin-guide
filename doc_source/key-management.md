You can specify AWS KMS keys, including bring your own keys \(BYOK\), to use for envelope encryption with Amazon S3 input/output buckets\. This also applies to data used stored in Amazon Connect Customer Profiles\.

Amazon AppIntegrations doesnâ€™t support BYOK for encryption of configuration data\.

The knowledge documents used by Amazon Connect Wisdom are encrypted by the customer\-owned KMS key\.

For information about AWS KMS keys see [What is AWS Key Management Service?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/overview.html) in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide*\.
