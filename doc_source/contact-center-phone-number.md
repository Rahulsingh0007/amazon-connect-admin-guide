# Set up phone numbers for your contact center<a name="contact-center-phone-number"></a>

After you create an Amazon Connect instance, you can claim a phone number to use for your contact center\. You can use this phone number to place a test call in to your contact center to confirm that it is working correctly\. You can also use it in your production environment\.

For pricing information about claimed phone number costs, see [Amazon Connect pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/connect/pricing/)\.

If you want to keep a phone number you already have, you can port the phone number and use it with Amazon Connect\. After a phone number is ported to Amazon Connect, it appears in the list of available phone numbers for you to assign to contact flows\.
