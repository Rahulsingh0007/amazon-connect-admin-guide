# How many contacts in queue on a specific date<a name="contacts-in-queue-on-specific-date"></a>

The historical metrics reports don't provide a way for you to determine how many contacts were in queue on a specific date, at a specific time\. 

To get this information in a historical report, you need the help of a developer\. The developer uses the [GetCurrentMetricData](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_GetCurrentMetricData.html) API to store the data so you can look it up later\.
